# Description

Based on [Slim3-Skeleton by Rob Allen][1] with somewhat modified folder structure (for easier frontend/backend development) plus a nice-looking admin interface. It includes:

 - Twig template engine
 - Flash Messages
 - Monolog
 - Pimple Dependency Injection Container
 - Dependency-aware Controllers (constructor injection)
 - Tracy Errors Handler
